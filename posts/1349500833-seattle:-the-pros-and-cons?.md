##Pros of Living in Seattle:

1. **Seattle is safe.** For a major metropolitan area, Seattle feels
   remarkably safe. Statistics consistently back this up, as violent
   crime rates are below the national average, and murder is relatively
   uncommon (for a major city). The vast majority of the city has a
   decidedly family-friendly atmosphere and safe, clean vibe.

2. **Seattle is full of smart people.** Seattle and the surrounding
   communities are home to some of the world's most innovative (and
   wildly successful) corporations. Companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
   Nintendo, Amazon, Starbucks, and countless "under the radar" tech
   startups all call the Seattle area home, and so do the incredibly
   intelligent people who work for them. As such, over 58% of the
   population is college educated (with a bachelors degree or
   higher), and almost 25% have a Master's degree or above. Whether
   you're looking for intellectual stimulation, or just smart people
   to have babies with, Seattle is the place to look.

3. **Seattle is surrounded by amazing scenery**, and is perfect for
   active lifestyles. Seattle's ideal location, with the Cascade
   Mountains to the east, and Puget Sound to the west (with the
   Olympic Mountains and Olympic National Park beyond), make it a
   year-round playground for those who love to be outside. Every
   conceivable outdoor activity is within reach, including
   world-class skiing, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, kayaking,
   and nearly anything else that might require "gear" or a
   compass. 


##Cons:

1. **The weather.** 

   The common myth is that Seattle is incredibly
   wet and rainy. The good news is that it's not that wet.
   Countless places in the United States (think New York,
   Washington DC, Atlanta) recieve more annual precipitation than
   Seattle The real problem is the utter lack of sun when rain
   stops. Winter in Seattle can feel oppressively grey and gloomy,
   especially to transplants from other parts of the US. 

2. **Distance/isolation from other US cities.** 

   Compared to the other parts of the United STates, Seattle is
   relatively far away from other major cities, and the options
   for day trips are pretty much limited to Vacouver, BC and
   Portland, OR. Flying to the East Coast or Midwest is pretty
   much an all-day affair. This sense of isolation can be
   another downside to living in Seattle, especially if you're
   from somewhere else, which seems to be almost everybody.

3. **Traffic Congestion**

   Commuting in Seattle can be a complete nightmare, with "rush
   hour" seemingly lasting about 3 hours in the morning and
   another 3 in the evening. The geographical constraints of
   being surrounded by water and mountains pretty much limits
   the options for road travel, and anywhere along the I-5
   corridor (going north or south out of the city) or either of
   the two "floating bridges" (the I-90 and State Route 520
   bridges accross Lake Washington are the primary routes in and
   out of the city from the east) is usually a parking lot
   during peak commute times. According to one national report,
   Seattle was tied with Atlanta, GA for the 10th worst traffic
   in the United States, although sometimes it feels much, much
   worse. 

##Popular/Fun Activities in Seattle:

There is no shortage of fun to be had in Seattle, whether
you're a tourist from Nebraska or a lifelong resident. Some
popular attractions include:

1. **Pike Place Market**

   Home of the Flying Fish, and the "original" Starbucks, as
   well as hundreds of other things to see, eat, do, and buy.
   Locals still come to this vibrant market on the waterfront
   downtown to get fresh seafood and produce, although they
   pretty much leave it to the tourists on busy summer weekends.

2. **International District**

   Seattle's "Chinatown" is a very authentic and interesting
   place to get a feel for Seattle's Asian community, which is
   very deeply rooted and a huge part of the culture of the
   city. There are LOTS of places to eat, and a poular favorite
   activity on weekends is eating Dim Sum at one of the many
   fine establishments in the area.

3. Experience Music Project

   The "EMP" is a world-class Rock & Roll museum located near
   the Space Needle. It has some of the most distinctive
   architecture of any building in the world, and it hosts a
   permanent tribute to Seattle's own Jimi Hendrix, as well as
   fantastic rotating exhibits throughout the year. 


##Seattle's Best Neighborhoods:

**Best Neighborhood for Singles**

   Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood is home to a vast array
   of music venues, bars, and clubs, as well as thousands of
   young, single people who frequent these places. Fremont
   (self-described "Center of the Universe") is another young
   and vibrant place with lots of single professionals.

**Best Neighborhood for Families:**

   Ballard is a popular place for families, with a nice mix of
   young families and long-established residents. Historic
   Downtown Ballard is where you will see strollers clogging the
   sidewalks while families eat brunch at one of the many poular
   cafes and restaurants. A popular farmers market and lots of
   unique shopping attract families to this neighborhood just
   north of downtown Seattle.

**Best Neighborhood for Students:**

   The University District, with the University of Washington
   (known as U-Dub) at it's heart, is the place to live if
   you're a student, or just want to act like one. Countless
   bars line the "Ave" (University Street) and a constant influx
   of students populate the many apartments and cheap rental
   houses that cater to them.
