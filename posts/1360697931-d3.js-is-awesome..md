##d3.js is your new bicycle.

My latest experiments while learning to harness the power and potential
of Mike Bostock's alarmingly great and useful javascript library. I made
a map of Military Installations, Ranges, and Training Areas located in the US,
using some data [published on data.gov](https://explore.data.gov/National-Security-and-Veterans-Affairs/Military-Installations-Ranges-and-Training-Areas/wcc7-57p3) by the Department of Defense,
along with _tons_ of help and inspiration from these (and other) awesome [mapping](http://bl.ocks.org/4657115) [examples](http://bl.ocks.org/4699541) by [mbostock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) himself.

I'm excited about the stuff that can be done with this, and I'm going to
continue to explore and hopefully post more detailed explanations and
techniques as I go along.
