*Hi there...this is an example of an article I (michaelcolenso) wrote at someone else's behest, and for someone else's benefit.*

##All you need is like. 

Love. It used to be everywhere. Apparently it was all you needed.

But times have changed, and in the modern era, whether or not you "like" something is so much more important. Everywhere you look, there's that thumb. It's how we keep score on the internets.

You posted a photo of your cat wearing a stormtrooper costume while riding a unicycle to your favorite social network? Did anybody "like" it? No? Didn't happen.

Thought your kid was cute? Think your band is good? Think somebody eles band is good? Only the 'Likes' can determine such things now. It doesn't matter what the truth is, or what beauty is, or what you think. 

It doesn't matter who you love. Only what you "like".

Now you can show the world what you "like" by wearing one of these awesome t-shirts with the iconic "thumbs up" logo in the ultra-familiar blue and white color scheme that is literally everywhere these days.

Trust us, you'll like these shirts!
