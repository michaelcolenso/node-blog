## ship it, dude.

I've installing other people's npm modules for a while now. I finally
published one of my own. it doesn't do much, and it's not too pretty,
but it's mine, and now it can be anyone's, thanks to npm, which is an
fantastic package manager. 

```
npm install stevetube

```

it scrapes the front page of youtube and shows the current videos. uses
express.js, request, and jsdom.
