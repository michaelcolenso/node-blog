              <div class='_post' id='1349500833'><h2>Pros of Living in Seattle:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Seattle is safe.</strong> For a major metropolitan area, Seattle feels
remarkably safe. Statistics consistently back this up, as violent
crime rates are below the national average, and murder is relatively
uncommon (for a major city). The vast majority of the city has a
decidedly family-friendly atmosphere and safe, clean vibe.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Seattle is full of smart people.</strong> Seattle and the surrounding
communities are home to some of the world&#39;s most innovative (and
wildly successful) corporations. Companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Nintendo, Amazon, Starbucks, and countless &quot;under the radar&quot; tech
startups all call the Seattle area home, and so do the incredibly
intelligent people who work for them. As such, over 58% of the
population is college educated (with a bachelors degree or
higher), and almost 25% have a Master&#39;s degree or above. Whether
you&#39;re looking for intellectual stimulation, or just smart people
to have babies with, Seattle is the place to look.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Seattle is surrounded by amazing scenery</strong>, and is perfect for
active lifestyles. Seattle&#39;s ideal location, with the Cascade
Mountains to the east, and Puget Sound to the west (with the
Olympic Mountains and Olympic National Park beyond), make it a
year-round playground for those who love to be outside. Every
conceivable outdoor activity is within reach, including
world-class skiing, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, kayaking,
and nearly anything else that might require &quot;gear&quot; or a
compass. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cons:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The weather.</strong> </p>
<p>The common myth is that Seattle is incredibly
wet and rainy. The good news is that it&#39;s not that wet.
Countless places in the United States (think New York,
Washington DC, Atlanta) recieve more annual precipitation than
Seattle The real problem is the utter lack of sun when rain
stops. Winter in Seattle can feel oppressively grey and gloomy,
especially to transplants from other parts of the US. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Distance/isolation from other US cities.</strong> </p>
<p>Compared to the other parts of the United STates, Seattle is
relatively far away from other major cities, and the options
for day trips are pretty much limited to Vacouver, BC and
Portland, OR. Flying to the East Coast or Midwest is pretty
much an all-day affair. This sense of isolation can be
another downside to living in Seattle, especially if you&#39;re
from somewhere else, which seems to be almost everybody.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Traffic Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Commuting in Seattle can be a complete nightmare, with &quot;rush
hour&quot; seemingly lasting about 3 hours in the morning and
another 3 in the evening. The geographical constraints of
being surrounded by water and mountains pretty much limits
the options for road travel, and anywhere along the I-5
corridor (going north or south out of the city) or either of
the two &quot;floating bridges&quot; (the I-90 and State Route 520
bridges accross Lake Washington are the primary routes in and
out of the city from the east) is usually a parking lot
during peak commute times. According to one national report,
Seattle was tied with Atlanta, GA for the 10th worst traffic
in the United States, although sometimes it feels much, much
worse. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Popular/Fun Activities in Seattle:</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of fun to be had in Seattle, whether
you&#39;re a tourist from Nebraska or a lifelong resident. Some
popular attractions include:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Pike Place Market</strong></p>
<p>Home of the Flying Fish, and the &quot;original&quot; Starbucks, as
well as hundreds of other things to see, eat, do, and buy.
Locals still come to this vibrant market on the waterfront
downtown to get fresh seafood and produce, although they
pretty much leave it to the tourists on busy summer weekends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>International District</strong></p>
<p>Seattle&#39;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; is a very authentic and interesting
place to get a feel for Seattle&#39;s Asian community, which is
very deeply rooted and a huge part of the culture of the
city. There are LOTS of places to eat, and a poular favorite
activity on weekends is eating Dim Sum at one of the many
fine establishments in the area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Experience Music Project</p>
<p>The &quot;EMP&quot; is a world-class Rock &amp; Roll museum located near
the Space Needle. It has some of the most distinctive
architecture of any building in the world, and it hosts a
permanent tribute to Seattle&#39;s own Jimi Hendrix, as well as
fantastic rotating exhibits throughout the year. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Seattle&#39;s Best Neighborhoods:</h2>
<p><strong>Best Neighborhood for Singles</strong>

</p>
<p>   Seattle&#39;s Capitol Hill neighborhood is home to a vast array
   of music venues, bars, and clubs, as well as thousands of
   young, single people who frequent these places. Fremont
   (self-described &quot;Center of the Universe&quot;) is another young
   and vibrant place with lots of single professionals.

</p>
<p><strong>Best Neighborhood for Families:</strong>

</p>
<p>   Ballard is a popular place for families, with a nice mix of
   young families and long-established residents. Historic
   Downtown Ballard is where you will see strollers clogging the
   sidewalks while families eat brunch at one of the many poular
   cafes and restaurants. A popular farmers market and lots of
   unique shopping attract families to this neighborhood just
   north of downtown Seattle.

</p>
<p><strong>Best Neighborhood for Students:</strong>

</p>
<p>   The University District, with the University of Washington
   (known as U-Dub) at it&#39;s heart, is the place to live if
   you&#39;re a student, or just want to act like one. Countless
   bars line the &quot;Ave&quot; (University Street) and a constant influx
   of students populate the many apartments and cheap rental
   houses that cater to them.
