              <div class='_post' id='1349502343'><h1>Quick and Easy Hacks to Keep More of your Money in Your Pocket Without Even Noticing</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Learn to cook.</strong> Seriously. It&#39;s not that hard to learn to fix 2-3 simple
and nutritious meals for yourself, and get into the habit of cooking for
yourself at least a couple nights a week. The benefits will not only
include saving money (and you will save a LOT of money) but you&#39;ll feel
better, look better, and you&#39;ll have learned a skill that you can expand
on for the rest of your life. This is probably the easiest, yet most
significant simple change you can make to your lifestyle that will
immediately have a positive impact on your pocketbook as well as your
health.

</p>
<p>If you&#39;re going to learn to cook, you may as well learn to shop, too.
The last thing you should do is wander into the supermarket without a
plan and start impulsively grabbing whatever looks enticing off the
shelves. Use a shopping planner type site like REDACTED
which allows you to compare supermarket prices as you shop so you can
get the best deals for your groceries. 

</p>
<p>Sites like this can also help you formulate your meal-planning, and cut
down on impulse buys in the market. (Protip: Never, ever go into the
supermarket to shop for groceries on an empty stomach. You&#39;ll end up
buying WAY more than you intended. If you go shopping when you&#39;re not
the least bit hungry, there&#39;s much less chance you&#39;ll be making
decisions with your stomach, which knows nothing of your budget.)

</p>
<p><strong>Use the library.</strong> So many people take the library for granted, when it&#39;s
one of the absolute best places to cut costs. Why buy cookbooks, or
guidebooks, or, quite frankly, ANY books? All of these are free to you
to borrow at the local library. Don&#39;t forget that most also have videos
and music available to borrow, too. A truly fantastic resource for the
frugally minded. Depending on your current spending habits, you could
potentially save hundreds per year just by stopping off by the library
rather than the bookshop or the record store.

</p>
<p><strong>Quit smoking.</strong> Nobody needs to remind you again of the health risks and
damage to your health your nasty little habit is causing. But if you
think about the amount of cash you could save by NOT buying a pack a
day, you may begin to wonder if it&#39;s worth it. Think about a fabulous
holiday on the beach somewhere that you&#39;re cheating yourself out of as
you watch your hard-earned cash go up in smoke. 

</p>
<p>When you think about it, there&#39;s a million little things that your can
do to save a few quid here and there. And when a million little things
start to add up, all of a sudden, you&#39;re talking about REAL MONEY, as
they say. Its not that hard. Start small, and start today.

              <div class='_post' id='1349500833'><h2>Pros of Living in Seattle:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Seattle is safe.</strong> For a major metropolitan area, Seattle feels
remarkably safe. Statistics consistently back this up, as violent
crime rates are below the national average, and murder is relatively
uncommon (for a major city). The vast majority of the city has a
decidedly family-friendly atmosphere and safe, clean vibe.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Seattle is full of smart people.</strong> Seattle and the surrounding
communities are home to some of the world&#39;s most innovative (and
wildly successful) corporations. Companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Nintendo, Amazon, Starbucks, and countless &quot;under the radar&quot; tech
startups all call the Seattle area home, and so do the incredibly
intelligent people who work for them. As such, over 58% of the
population is college educated (with a bachelors degree or
higher), and almost 25% have a Master&#39;s degree or above. Whether
you&#39;re looking for intellectual stimulation, or just smart people
to have babies with, Seattle is the place to look.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Seattle is surrounded by amazing scenery</strong>, and is perfect for
active lifestyles. Seattle&#39;s ideal location, with the Cascade
Mountains to the east, and Puget Sound to the west (with the
Olympic Mountains and Olympic National Park beyond), make it a
year-round playground for those who love to be outside. Every
conceivable outdoor activity is within reach, including
world-class skiing, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, kayaking,
and nearly anything else that might require &quot;gear&quot; or a
compass. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cons:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The weather.</strong> </p>
<p>The common myth is that Seattle is incredibly
wet and rainy. The good news is that it&#39;s not that wet.
Countless places in the United States (think New York,
Washington DC, Atlanta) recieve more annual precipitation than
Seattle The real problem is the utter lack of sun when rain
stops. Winter in Seattle can feel oppressively grey and gloomy,
especially to transplants from other parts of the US. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Distance/isolation from other US cities.</strong> </p>
<p>Compared to the other parts of the United STates, Seattle is
relatively far away from other major cities, and the options
for day trips are pretty much limited to Vacouver, BC and
Portland, OR. Flying to the East Coast or Midwest is pretty
much an all-day affair. This sense of isolation can be
another downside to living in Seattle, especially if you&#39;re
from somewhere else, which seems to be almost everybody.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Traffic Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Commuting in Seattle can be a complete nightmare, with &quot;rush
hour&quot; seemingly lasting about 3 hours in the morning and
another 3 in the evening. The geographical constraints of
being surrounded by water and mountains pretty much limits
the options for road travel, and anywhere along the I-5
corridor (going north or south out of the city) or either of
the two &quot;floating bridges&quot; (the I-90 and State Route 520
bridges accross Lake Washington are the primary routes in and
out of the city from the east) is usually a parking lot
during peak commute times. According to one national report,
Seattle was tied with Atlanta, GA for the 10th worst traffic
in the United States, although sometimes it feels much, much
worse. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Popular/Fun Activities in Seattle:</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of fun to be had in Seattle, whether
you&#39;re a tourist from Nebraska or a lifelong resident. Some
popular attractions include:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Pike Place Market</strong></p>
<p>Home of the Flying Fish, and the &quot;original&quot; Starbucks, as
well as hundreds of other things to see, eat, do, and buy.
Locals still come to this vibrant market on the waterfront
downtown to get fresh seafood and produce, although they
pretty much leave it to the tourists on busy summer weekends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>International District</strong></p>
<p>Seattle&#39;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; is a very authentic and interesting
place to get a feel for Seattle&#39;s Asian community, which is
very deeply rooted and a huge part of the culture of the
city. There are LOTS of places to eat, and a poular favorite
activity on weekends is eating Dim Sum at one of the many
fine establishments in the area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Experience Music Project</p>
<p>The &quot;EMP&quot; is a world-class Rock &amp; Roll museum located near
the Space Needle. It has some of the most distinctive
architecture of any building in the world, and it hosts a
permanent tribute to Seattle&#39;s own Jimi Hendrix, as well as
fantastic rotating exhibits throughout the year. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Seattle&#39;s Best Neighborhoods:</h2>
<p><strong>Best Neighborhood for Singles</strong>

</p>
<p>   Seattle&#39;s Capitol Hill neighborhood is home to a vast array
   of music venues, bars, and clubs, as well as thousands of
   young, single people who frequent these places. Fremont
   (self-described &quot;Center of the Universe&quot;) is another young
   and vibrant place with lots of single professionals.

</p>
<p><strong>Best Neighborhood for Families:</strong>

</p>
<p>   Ballard is a popular place for families, with a nice mix of
   young families and long-established residents. Historic
   Downtown Ballard is where you will see strollers clogging the
   sidewalks while families eat brunch at one of the many poular
   cafes and restaurants. A popular farmers market and lots of
   unique shopping attract families to this neighborhood just
   north of downtown Seattle.

</p>
<p><strong>Best Neighborhood for Students:</strong>

</p>
<p>   The University District, with the University of Washington
   (known as U-Dub) at it&#39;s heart, is the place to live if
   you&#39;re a student, or just want to act like one. Countless
   bars line the &quot;Ave&quot; (University Street) and a constant influx
   of students populate the many apartments and cheap rental
   houses that cater to them.

              <a href="/sleep-positions"><h2>Sleep Positions <small class="timefield t:1349500802000"></small></h2></a>
              <div class='_post' id='1349500802'><h1>Are you doing it right? How your sleeping position can affect your health</h1>
<p>Few people pay much attention to the position of their body while they
sleep. Most of us just settle into whatever feels comfortable, and
hopefully drift off into dreamland relatively peacefully. However, there
are medical and physiological impacts to the way you sleep, and you may
be potentially putting yourself at greater risk for certain disorders by
sleeping the &quot;wrong way&quot;. 

</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick rundown of the different sleep positions and what they
can mean for your health:

</p>
<p><strong>From Worst to First:</strong>

</p>
<h3>Sleep Position: Stomach</h3>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s terrible:</strong>

</p>
<p>If you want to put added stress on your joints, muscles, and spine,
sleep on your stomach. If you find yourself waking up in the morning
with more than the typical aches and pains, trying to stop sleeping on
your belly might be a good move. Experts say that sleeping on your
stomach makes it difficult for your spine to remain in a neutral
position, and increases the tension in this complicated and most vital
area. Ask anyone with chronic back pain. Your spine doesn&#39;t need any
more work than it already has, thank you very much. 
Potential Exception: If you snore, sleeping on your stomach may help
open up your airways that lead to those disturbing sounds. If your
sleeping partner is fed up with your snoring, and you don&#39;t already have
a bad back, give it a shot. It might save your relationship.

</p>
<h3>Sleep Position: The Fetal Position</h3>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s not so good:</strong>

</p>
<p>Sleeping every night curled up into a little ball may feel comforting to
some, but those who have stuck with this position since they started
doing it in the womb may be causing undue stress on the back and neck.
You could also be restricting your breathing, and who wants that? Try
and straighten it out a little bit, and you&#39;ll feel betetr overall. And
get your thumb out of your mouth. Please. It&#39;s embarrassing for
everybody.

</p>
<h3>Sleep Position: On your Side</h3>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s pretty ok:</strong>

</p>
<p>Sleeping on your side can prevent many of the issues caused by prolonged
bouts of spinal tension and curvature, making it less likely to
conribute to back and neck pain. Your spine is able to stay elongated in
this position, which is just how it likes to be. A happy spine is a
happy body. A word of caution, though if you have breasts (especially if
they&#39;re real, and fantastic): Sleeping on your side may cause sagging.
But you know, so does gravity, and that&#39;s pretty unavoidable. Pro-Tip:
If you&#39;re pregnant, sleeping on the left side of your body promotes good
blood flow. Gotta have good blood flow.

</p>
<h3>Sleep Position: On your Back</h3>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s the best:</strong>

</p>
<p>Sleeping on your back is the best thing you can do to prevent your
nightly snoozes from slowly killing you. Back-sleepers are giving their
spine, neck, and head a break by allowing them to remain in a natural,
neutral position. Other benefits include less chance of acid reflux
(nasty stuff has a hard time moving uphill, so if you&#39;re head is
elevated a little, it&#39;s a good thing). Additionally, since sleeping on
your back usually means nothing is smushed up against your pretty face
(unless you have a cat) this decreases your chance of premature
wrinkles. Your face needs it&#39;s space.

</p>
<p>So tonight when you shut it down and climb into bed, remember that how
you sleep can have a huge impact on how you feel, and how you live. So
choose wisely.

</p>
<p>Sleep tight, and don&#39;t let the bed bugs bite.

              <div class='_post' id='1349499997'><h1>How to Choose the Best Appliance Repair Service for Your Home Appliances</h1>
<hr>
<p>Your Appliances in your home are probably some of the most valuable
items you own, outside of your house and car. You rely on your
appliances to work when you need them, because life without them isn&#39;t
something most of us want to deal with. You never realize how reliant
you are on your appliances until something goes wrong. When a home
appliance breaks, it&#39;s often (always) at the most inconvenient or
unfortunate time, and you are forced to scramble around searching for
the right Appliance Repair Service to help you put your life back
together again.

</p>
<p>But, how do you know who to call? How do you know if the appliance
repair service company is qualified to do the work quickly and
efficiently? How can you choose the right appliance repair company for
you?


</p>
<hr>
<h3>4 Steps to Choosing the Perfect Appliance Repair Service</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Do they employ technicians who are certified to repair your
appliances?</p>
<p>All appliance manufacturers offer and often require the technicians
that perform repairs on their equipment be certified and trained to a
certain standard. You can ask this question of the appliance repair
service that you are considering, and they should have a reasonable
answer. Don&#39;t allow unqualified people to perform critical repairs to
your appliances, as you&#39;ll only be inviting trouble. Certified and
qualified repair technicians can easily diagnose issues and
troubleshoot problems, often avoiding complicated and expensive
solutions when possible. Additionally, if the equipment is still
covered by the factory warranty, you&#39;ll want a qualified technician
performing the work so you don&#39;t void the warranty or further damage
your equipment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does the appliance repair service keep commonly replaced or
repaired items in stock, or at least have access to them, so you
can avoid delay while the company is waiting for a required part
to be shipped? There is nothing more frustrating than  being told
that your critical appliance is unable to be repaired in a timely
manner because the service company is waiting for a part to be
delivered. Sometimes this is unavoidable, but it is certainly
within your rights to ask the question and look elsewhere if the
response you receive isn&#39;t to your liking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How quickly can the appliance repair company dispatch a
technician to your home? This is often the deciding factor when
choosing a repair service, since typically appliances do not
malfunction during normal business hours. Do they have someone
on-call that can respond quickly and address your problem? Is
there an additional fee or charge for this off-hours repair?
Again, these may not be the only reasons you choose an
appliance repair service, but you should be aware of the
possibilities and prepared to deal with them if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is the business reputable? Do they belong to the Better
 Business Bureau? Chamber of Commerce? What is their general
 reputation? Ask around, check internet reviews, talk to your
 friends and neighbors. If the appliance repair service is
 known for being a bad customer service provider, or you hear
 consistently negative things, take this under consideration
 and perhaps look elsewhere. An appliance repair service is
 only as good as it&#39;s reputation, and a quality company will
 stand out when you&#39;re looking to hire someone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, choosing the right appliance repair service is a
matter of common sense, and asking the right questions.
Don&#39;t be intimidated, and don&#39;t be worried that your
questions will be seen as dumb or inappropriate. A quality
company will be more than glad to show you why you should
choose them for repairs to some of your most complicated and
expensive belongings.

              <div class='_post' id='1349480742'><h1>4 Ways that a Photography Travel Tour Can Enhance your Photo Skills as well as your Life</h1>
<p>Specialty travel is a great way to see the world while pursuing a deeper understanding of a specific interest or passion. For those who have a special love for the photographic arts, &quot;seeing&quot; the world has an even deeper meaning. 

</p>
<p>Photography travel tours are an amazing and rewarding way to visit some of the most stunning locations on the planet, while sharing the experience with others who also have a passion for photography. 

</p>
<p>Photographers, whether they are savvy professionals, or wide-eyed and fumbling amateurs, all share a unique perspective that comes from trying to understand the elements of a great photograph. Taking a Photography Travel Tour e,specially with an experienced and knowledgable guide, allows for a shared experience that cannot be replicated otherwise. 

</p>
<h3>Here are 4 ways booking a Photography Tour can make you a better photographer and a better person:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>The simple act of taking photos as part of a group, whether large or small, leads to discussions about craft, composition, and technique that can only be had between those who speak the language and share a love for making better pictures. It&#39;s through these discussions, informally with others who are experiencing the same things, that invaluable lessons can be learned. It&#39;s impossible not to learn from others, consciously or otherwise. Just the simple act of being with people who are also passionate about photography can lead to some amazing discoveries. These discoveries, whether technological or artistic or both, are why you will never forget the shared experiences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An organized tour will put you in position to take the best possible photographs, and make the most of your limited time. You&#39;ll be much better able to relax and enjoy the journey if you know the details have been meticulously worked out and accounted for by travel professionals, and you get the added benefit of traveling with a variety of experienced photographers (both your guide and potentially your companions) who can recognize the magical nature of light and incorporate that into your experience. Imagine trying to convince a cruise ship captain to stay in port a few more hours because the light is just starting to get interesting? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Your itinerary is crafted to bring out the best in you as a photographer. You&#39;ll have the opportunities to capture and experience so many types of environments and settings, each one asking something different of you as an artist and a person. Knowing how to react and adapt to these types of changing circumstances is crucial to your development as a photographer and as a person.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the first time ever, when you return from your trip, people will actually be ASKING to see your vacation photos. And for the first time, you&#39;ll probably have more than a few that are worth sharing. And more importantly, you&#39;ll have experiences and stories to rival your photos, and the rest of your life to share them with others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Photography travel is a wonderful way to share your love for making photos with others who feel the same way. The quality of the pictures you take on your trip may or may not end up how you dreamed they would, but the common experience and shared joy of the journey is truly something that you will cherish for a lifetime.
